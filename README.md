# Culminating-BattleShip
Welcome to: Ultimate Battleship Simulator Extreme Warmachine 9001 XXX!!!
This game is a fun interactive battleship with a new take on battleship. You fight against the aliens in outer space, and the objective of the game is to destroy all enemy ships. Each of your ships have different amounts of health and have a critical system point. So does your enemy though! After you have placed the ships, you begin the battle for the galaxy! You can pick which ship you wish to fire, however each of them have a one turn cooldown, so choose wisely! Follow the steps and enjoy. This is a strategy game and may take 200IQ to understand.

The steps to run this game correctly are as follows:
Launch the program!
Press any key to begin.
After displaying a grid, the user will be asked to place the head of each ship, and the ships will automatically build down.
After placing all ships, the player must minimize the window and press “OK” on the pop-up window which will display your grid with the ships health.
The user is asked which of the 5 different ships they would like to fire.
When firing a ship, the user will receive a hit or a miss, with hit having the chance to do critical damage. Each ship has a one turn cooldown.
The aliens will fire after every user fire, and that is basically the game.
Grind to beat the aliens (it is a hard grind).
